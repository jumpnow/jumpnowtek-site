These are some notes I was gathering for a talk on Linux ARM [shellcode][shellcode] to present at a local [OWASP][owasp-me] meetup.

Some familiarity with Linux systems programing is assumed, but not necessarily any ARM assembly knowledge.

Below were my primary references putting together these posts

* Computerphile [Buffer Overflow Attack][computerphile] video - General overview and a good start (I like all their videos)
* [Azeria Labs][azeria-labs] - Probably the best reference on ARM specific shellcoding
* [ARM Systems Developers Guide][arm-sys-dev-guide] - Assembly reference book
* Shellstorm [Shellcode on ARM][shellstorm] - Tutorial with link to a database of examples
* Steve Hanna @ vividmachines [Shellcoding for Linux and Windows Tutorial][vivid-machines] - Focus on x86 but good explanations 
* [Billy Ellis][billy-ellis] - Focus on iOS targets
