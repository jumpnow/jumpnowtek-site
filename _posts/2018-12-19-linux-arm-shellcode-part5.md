One defense against memory exploits is to vary the locations of a program's different memory segments on every execution.

Linux refers to this mitigation strategy as "address space layout randomization" or **ASLR** for short.

To make writing these examples easier and consistent when I come back to them, I will temporary disable this on the test system.

First a short check to see if **ASLR** is working.

	#include <stdio.h>

	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
			char buff[64];

			printf("buff address: %p\n", buff);

			return 0;
	}


Build and run a few times.

	$ gcc main.c -o main

	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbea3abc0

	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbe9f8bc0

	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbefd9bc0

	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbede8bc0

	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbeb9cbc0

A different stack address every run. (Note that only the lower 24-bits were randomized.)

To completely disable **ASLR**

    # cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
	2

	# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
	
Now running that same test program

	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbefffbc0
	
	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbefffbc0

	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbefffbc0
	
	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbefffbc0
	
	$ ./main
	buff address: 0xbefffbc0

Running a program under the debugger also disables **ASLR**.
